This repository is for storing files related to my master thesis: Exploration And Development of Visual Controlled CNC system.

MPCNC custom Marlin was too big to be uploaded here. 
So it has been uploaded to Google Drive instead at

SolidWorks Assembly and files were also too big to be uploaded in GitHub.

To use the VisualCNC system, import VisCNC_GUI.py, Library.py, and Main Script.py in any python IDE. 
Make sure that all dependencies has been installed, set your user variables and start the system by running the GUI file.
