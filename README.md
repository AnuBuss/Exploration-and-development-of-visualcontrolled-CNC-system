Aleksander SÃ¸rup Lund - Master Thesis

This repository is for storing files related to my master thesis: Exploration And Development of Visual Controlled CNC system.

MPCNC custom Marlin was too big to be uploaded here. 
So it has been uploaded to Google Drive instead at 
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13NcbRvna6SFS6kxPQ3BpxM_rXiQOYfbY?usp=sharing.

To use the VisualCNC system, import VisCNC_GUI.py, Library.py, and Main Script.py in any python IDE. 
Make sure that all dependencies has been installed, set your user variables and start the system by running the GUI file.
